## About myself

I am working as an leading automation engineer in petrochemical industry.
My experience in programming is outside the field of web development. Programm
languages that i know are not applicable here, except, I think, SQL only. Recently I
considered to try something new and I started this course. My experience in web
development is too little until but I am very interested in this activity. I hope this
course will help me understand if i can work this way.
